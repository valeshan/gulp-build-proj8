# GULP PROJECT 8

This project uses gulp to serve, concat (sass and js files) and minify files(css, js and img files).

Download necessary dependencies with:
```
npm install 
```
In the CLI, enter:
```
gulp
```
This automatically serves and compiles the files onto port `8080`. `Livereload` is listening to changes in `.scss` files located in the `sass` folder.

Then visit:
```
localhost:8080
```
